Release of H5View, Version 1.0
==============================

We are pleased to announce the release of H5View, a graphic utility for
viewing the contents of HDF5 files.  H5View requires the Java HDF5 Interface.

Version 1.0 is the first release of H5View.  It was intended to provide
basic browsing of HDF5 files.  More advanced browsing and editing features 
will be included in future releases and/or other tools.  

You can download H5View from:
 
   http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf5-html/H5View/

An H5View User's Guide is also available at:

   http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf5-html/H5View/UsersGuide/index.html


Features:
--------

Following is a list of the features of the current H5View.  Please
refer to the H5View User's Guide for detailed information regarding these
features.

 *  Loads HDF5, ASCII and Java supported image (e.g. gif, jpeg) files. 
 *  Supports viewing multiple data objects. 
 *  Displays the group structure of an HDF5 file. 
 *  Shows the HDF5 metadata and user defined attributes of HDF5 objects. 
 *  Displays a string-typed dataset in a text window. 
 *  Displays HDF5 images (datasets with numerical data and associated 
    color table). 
 *  Displays a numerical dataset (up to 3 dimensions) in a "spreadsheet". 
 *  Views the content of named datatypes. 
 *  Zooms in/out image. 
 *  Shows image palette. 


Limitations: 
-----------

The current implementation of H5View has the following limitations. 

 *  H5View does not support HDF4 files. 
 *  H5View does not support editing/saving features. 
 *  H5View does not support data subsetting. 
 *  H5View displays data up to 3 dimensions. 
 *  H5View does not support nested compound datatypes. 
 *  Only supports 8-bit RGB color models. 
 *  Opening a large image/data object may not work due to the 
    limitations of the Java virtual machine. 
 *  H5View is implemented in JavaTM 2 Platform. 
    It does not work on JDK 1.x.
