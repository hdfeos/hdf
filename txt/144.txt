Windows standard will move to VS 2013 with Intel 15, though testing will
continue on VS 2012.

The HDF Group Software Highlights
=================================

o The H4CF Conversion Toolkit 1.0 release is now available.

  This toolkit enables NASA HDF-EOS2 and HDF4 products to be converted to
  follow CF conventions. The utilities are especially useful for NASA
  HDF-EOS2 and HDF4 end-users to visualize and analyze the converted
  netCDF3 or netCDF4 files with their favorite netCDF tools or applications.

  This release includes a few critical memory leak fixes and improved error
  handling. Also, CF support was added for TRMM version 7 and AIRS version 6
  NASA products.
