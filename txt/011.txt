===============================
HDF 3.3 release 1 now available
===============================

NCSA is pleased to announce the release of HDF 3.3r1. HDF 3.3r1 is 
available on on the NCSA ftp server (ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; IP address 
141.142.20.50) in the directory HDF/HDF3.3r1.  README files in this 
directory and subdirectories contain full details on the new features 
of HDF 3.3, as well as directions on how to download, install and use 
it.

Briefly, HDF 3.3 contains the following new features:

    - A new SDS interface that has the following features:

        * 'multi-file access': support for access to more than one 
          file at a time, and more than one SDS at a time.
        * 'name = value' style meta-data: support for a more general 
          framework for meta-data within the SDS data model, allowing 
        * support for an "unlimited dimension" within the SDS data
          model
        * The ability to read and write random hyperslabs
        * the ability to subsample arrays
        * the ability to access netCDF files via the SDS interface

    - JPEG compression: the 8-bit and 24-bit interfaces now read and 
      write JPEG compressed 24-bit and 8-bit raster images

    - Support for the netCDF data model, with the following features:

        * the ability to use the entire netCDF 2.3.2 interface to
          write data to HDF files
        * the ability to read SDS data via the netCDF interface
        * the ability to read netCDF data from files in the netCDF
          format developed at Unidata

    - Improved conversion routines on the Cray, providing faster access
      for SDS and Vdata I/O.

    - The ability to read and write little-endian (PC native) mode
      files on all platforms, expanding the capabilities of the
      SDS and Vdata interfaces.

    - Vset interface changes, including

        * the ability to store more than one field of order greater
          than one in a vdata
        * several new routines for finding information about Vdata field
          attributes
        * the use of integers rather than pointers for Vgroup and Vdata
          identifiers, to make them more compatible with the other HDF
          interfaces.

The HDF 3.3 library is composed of two main parts.  The first part, the 
"base library" includes all interfaces that were supported prior to HDF 
3.3, including any enhancements to those interfaces added in HDF 3.3.  
The second part, the HDF/netCDF part, contains the new multi-file SDS 
interface and the netCDF interface.  

HDF 3.3 Release 1 has been tested successfully on the following 
machines:.

Platform                'base library'              HDF/netCDF

  * The netCDF interface works but you currently are unable to read old 
   netCDF(XDR) files. In addtion, the fortran interface and ncdump
   utility has yet to be finished.

 ** There is no FORTRAN support for either PC version of HDF 3.3.


========================
Update on HDF/contrib/
========================

Vsettools -- vs2ris and vs2ps:
-----------------------------
Fred Walsteijn, Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research at
Utrecht University of The Netherlands, upgraded the Vset
conversion tools vs2ris and vs2ps to HDF3.2r4. The previous
version (v2.1) compiled with HDF3.2r2 and was contributed by Fred 
last year December.

The programs, accompanied by README files and example data,
are in directory HDF3.2r4.Vsettools/.

inspectHDF:
----------
Last August Neil Buesing updated inspectHDF to HDF3.3b2 and 
improved its functionality. The updated version is now available 
in the subdirectory inspectHDF/.

fits2hdf:
--------
Niall Ives Gaffney contributed a fits2hdf utility which
converts FITS files into HDF files. The programs are in
directory fits2hdf/. There are also README and a Makefile
in the same directory. 



====================
Update on  XCollage:
====================

NCSA XCollage version 1.2 has now been released and is available on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Here is a list of the changes and enhancements in the
new version.

Changes when generating a raster picture from a SDS :
-----------------------------------------------------
  - prompt user to modify the minimum and maximum that will be used to
    compute a raster value from a float or integer value.
  - default the output raster range to 30-254. Settable through X resources:
        Collage.basePixel & Colllage.lastPixel
  - optional bilinear interpolation.

Changes in the Rasters Windows :
-------------------------------
  - By default, the first 30 entries of the colormap are the same as those 
       of the system colormap so that it doesn't "flash" when you enter 
       this window.
  - In the palette menu, the current palette is shown with an indented
       diamond.

Changes in the Histogram tool :
------------------------------
  - when data come from a SDS, computation is made with the SDS data instead of 
        the raster data, and so the labels show floating or integer values.
  - User can change the number (hence, the size) of intervals thru the Options
        menu.

Changes in the Plot or Profile tool :
-------------------------------------
  - here too, when data come from a SDS, use the SDS data instead of the 
        raster data and displays the data in the scale labels.

Creates contours for images which were generated from SDS's.
------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in the Animation tool :
------------------------------
  - Three options when loading an animation :
        you can use the X server memory (Pixmaps), client memory or
        store the picture on disk.
  - New slider to control the speed of animation
  - when loading SDS, prompt the user for magnification (does not interpolate)

Load a file from command line :
-------------------------------
  - the -load <file> option enables the user to load a file without going
        through the browser.

GIF, XWD support :
-----------------
  - Collage support reading images from GIF or XWD formatted files.

New 3D features :
----------------
  -  pops up a new panel when you load three dimensionnal data enabling
        the user to choose an axis and a plane perpendicular to this axis,
        and display the plane either as a spreadsheet or a raster image.

New communication features :
--------------------------
  - When generating a raster image from an SDS, the image is now sent to
        everybody on the session and the receiving collage instances are
        now able to link this raster image with the original SDS, in order
        to use it in the profile & histogram tool.
  - When sending the palette that goes with a raster image, we keep the
        original name of the palette, instead of renaming it to the name
        of the raster image. The receiving side is now able to link
        the palette with the raster image using a new tag in the DTM header.
