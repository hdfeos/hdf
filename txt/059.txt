Release of HDF5-1.4.1
=====================

HDF5-1.4.1 is now available for download.  The changes in this release
are primarily to the HDF5 utilities, and not all features were tested.
Therefore, we have not provided the entire pre-compiled binary distribution
(libraries, include files, utilities) for the platforms we support.  We do
provide the pre-compiled utilities as well as the source code for HDF5-1.4.1.

You can obtain the HDF5-1.4.1 software from the HDF5 home page or from
the NCSA ftp server:

   ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/

The HDF5 home page is located at:

   http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/

Documentation is included in the source code and can also be
found in:

   ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/docs/


New Features and Changes
------------------------

   * XML output option for h5dump utility.

     A new option --xml to output data in XML format has been added. The
     XML output contains a complete description of the file, marked up in
     XML.

     The XML conforms to the HDF5 Document Type Definition (DTD), which
     is available at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.dtd

     The XML output is suitable for use with other tools, including the
     Java Tools:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf5-html/

   * h4toh5 utility: conversion of images is fixed

     Earlier releases of the h4toh5 utility produced images that did not
     correctly conform to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

     Several required HDF5 attributes were omitted, and the dataspace
     was reversed (i.e., the height and width of the image dataset were
     incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/H5Image/ImageDetails.htm

   * Fixed bug with contiguous hyperslabs not being detected, causing
     slower I/O than necessary.

   * Fixed bug where non-aligned hyperslab I/O on chunked datasets was
     causing errors during I/O.

   * The RCSID string in H5public.h caused a C++ compiling problem,
     due to multiple definitions of the same static variable.  All
     occurences of the RCSID definition were removed.

   * PDF and Postscript versions of the HDF5 documents are available
     with this release from:
        http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/PSandPDF/
        ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/docs/

Known Problems
--------------

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * The shared library failed compilation on IRIX 6.5.

    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload
      the source from the tar file before doing another build.

    * See "Known problems" section for the HDF5 1.4.0 release in the
      HISTORY.txt file.


Release of Java HDF5 Products
=============================

The latest version of the Java HDF5 Products which has been updated to work
with HDF5-1.4.1 is now available from:

     http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf5-html/

Several new features have been added to H5View in this release:

    * Can convert an XML file into HDF5 and then open it.
    * Can convert an HDF4 file into HDF5 and then open it.
    * Save a file as XML.
    * Many new editing features.

Please refer to the java-hdf5-html/ web page for a comprehensive
list of all of the changes.


More HDF5 tools support XML
===========================

This release features an initial set of tools that convert between
XML and HDF5 (and vice versa).

The initial tool set includes:
  * A standard Document Type Definition (DTD)
  * Java tools to read XML and create HDF5
  * Addition of XML output to the h5dump utility.

These tools use the standard DTD, and the same XML can be read
and written by all the tools.

More information about the tools and XML is available at:
   http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/XML
