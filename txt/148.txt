This release contains many important new features and changes, including those
listed below. The features marked with * use new extensions to the HDF5 file
format. 

 o The Single-Writer / Multiple-Reader or SWMR feature enables users to read
   data while concurrently writing it. *

 o The virtual dataset (VDS) feature enables users to access data in a
   collection of HDF5 files as a single HDF5 dataset and to use the HDF5 APIs
   to work with that dataset. *

   NOTE: There is a known issue with the h5repack utility when using it to
   modify the layout of a VDS. We understand the issue and are working on a
   patch for it.

 o New indexing structures for chunked datasets were added to support SWMR
   and to optimize performance. *
 
 o Persistent free file space can now be managed and tracked for better
   performance. *
  
 o The HDF5 Collective Metadata I/O feature has been added to improve
   performance when reading and writing data collectively with Parallel HDF5.

 o The Java HDF5 JNI has been integrated into HDF5.

 o Changes were made in how autotools handles large file support (LFS).

 o New options for the storage and filtering of partial edge chunks have been
   added for performance tuning.*

Files created with the new extensions will not be readable by applications
based on the HDF5-1.8 library.
