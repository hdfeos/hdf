Release of HDF5 1.8.13
======================

The HDF5-1.8.13 release is now available, and can be downloaded from the
HDF Group Downloads page:

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/

It can also be obtained directly from:

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

HDF5-1.8.13 is a minor release, with a few new features and changes.
Important changes include:

 o The H5free_memory (C) api was added to free memory that was allocated
   by HDF5 API calls. This was added specifically for Windows, but may be
   useful anywhere that the library uses a different memory manager than
   the application.

 o New wrappers were added for C++ (many) and Fortran
   (h5pset_file_image_f and h5pget_file_image_f).

 o Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks is now supported.

 o Many improvements were added in support of CMake, including the
   addition of support for CMake 2.8.11.
 
 o Improvements were added to the Core VFD (or Memory VFD).

 o The following changes were made to Parallel HDF5:
   
   - The MPI-POSIX VFD was removed. Application developers should
     always use the MPI-IO VFD.

   - Parallel HDF5 now supports collective I/O on point selections.

 o A few changes were added to the tools (h5diff, h5dump, and h5repack).

This release contains many other changes that are not listed here.
Please be sure to read the Release Notes for a comprehensive list of

Future Changes to Supported Platforms
-------------------------------------

Please be aware that after this release, we will be moving to
CMake 3.0, and will add testing for VS 2013. VS 2012 will remain
the standard.

In addition, we will only support Cygwin built with CMake, and will
be dropping VS 2010.
