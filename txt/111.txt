Platforms Tested
----------------

This release was built and tested for the following platforms:

 32-bit distribution -- runs on 32-bit systems or 64-bit systems with 32-bit
 JRE

    * Linux
    * Mac Intel
    * Solaris
    * Windows

 64-bit distribution -- runs on 64-bit systems with 64-bit JRE

    * Linux x86_64
    * Linux ia64
    * Mac Intel
    * Solaris 64-bit


Major Improvements
------------------

    * Memory leak fixed in the HDF-Java native.
    * Added H5.getOpenIDCount() and H5.getOpenID() to track any open IDs.
      These functions can be very useful for checking memory leaks for
      applications. 
    * Added features to show data pointed to by object references
      and region references.
    * Added find/search dataset from HDFView.
    * Added user option to open a file directly with read-only mode.
    * It now shows unsigned 64-bit integer.
    * It supports netcdf3 files for the NETCDF module (ncsa.hdf.object.nc2.NC2File).


Major Bug Fixes
---------------

    * HDFView: Incorrectly displays data-type: character array
    * HDFView: if change palette then flip image, original colorscale is used
    * Local version of HDFView doc has broken links etc.
    * HDView: indices changed between 2.3 and 2.4. Why?
    * HDFView does not show preceding spaces for attribute values that begin
      with spaces
    * HDFView uses incorrect image values
    * HDFView: "Show Value" is always 0 if show image for 32-bit unsigned
      array
    * HDF4 object package failed on reading data
    * Incorrect Size of variable length dataset
    * Problem on import/export strings in compound datasets in HDFView
    * HDFView doc does not mention can save to PNG, GIF, BMP
    * HDFView: rainbow palette selection is different depending on where it is
      selected
    * Remove HDFCDataTypes from web page
    * HDFView: can't view contents of group if has same name as file
    * HDFView - Get error if open a compound dataset with string and reference
    * H5Sselect_hyperslab parameter order in header comment is wrong
    * High dim label is wrong
    * 16-bit and 32-bit images do not scale properly if set range
    * Use better memory allocation in HDF4 JNI to avoid crash on OutOfMemory
      error on large dataset.
    * Show some HDF-EOS attributes stored in HDF4 vdata.
    * Fix a problem of displaying information for HDF4 vdata without name.
    * Add HDF-Java logging levels to HDF5 JNI and set default level to
      "SEVERE".
