HDF5 1.8.0 Beta 1 Released
==========================

We are very pleased to announce that HDF5 1.8.0 Beta 1 has been released.

Please see the following for HDF5 1.8.0 Beta software and information:

   http://www.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/HDF5/release/beta/obtain518.html

A list of the new features in HDF5 1.8.0 can be found at:

   http://www.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc_1.8pre/WhatsNew180.html

location:

   http://www.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc_1.8pre/

There are many bug fixes and new features in this release, and we
encourage you to try it.  If you encounter any problems, please let
the THG Helpdesk (help@hdfgroup.org) know as soon as possible.



HDF Corruption Problem
======================

A corruption problem has been discovered in the HDF MFHDF (SD) library,
which can occur when an SDS and a dimension have the same name.  In
the HDF 4.2r1 release, one-dimensional datasets can be corrupted.  Prior
to HDF 4.2r1, both one and two-dimensional datasets could be corrupted.

HDF allows you to create a dimension with the same name as an SDS,
although this should not be possible and is a violation of the netCDF
model.  The corruption occurs when an attribute or a dimension scale is
added to the dimension that has the same name as the existing SDS.

Please refer to the HDF 4.2r1 Known Problems page for detailed information
on this issue:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/known_problems.html#corrupt

We are working on a fix to correct this problem.



Dropping Support for MSVC++ 6.0 and Dec Visual Fortran 6.6
==========================================================

We would like to drop support for MSVC++ 6.0 and Dec Visual
Fortran 6.6.  If you would like for us to continue support
for these compilers, please notify the THG Helpdesk (help@hdfgroup.org).



"hdf-forum" Mailing List
========================

A mailing list is available to users for discussing HDF/HDF5 issues among
each other.  The name of this list is:

   hdf-forum@hdfgroup.org

This list is intended for questions that are either beyond what the
THG Helpdesk can answer or that are of interest to all users.

To subscribe to this list, send a message to:
    hdf-forum-subscribe@hdfgroup.org

For more information, see the following page:

   http://hdfgroup.org/support.html


 
HDF/HDF5 Conversion Tools ?
===========================

Do you have HDF/HDF5 conversion tools (to or from NetCDF, geotiff,
grib, ASCII, etc..) that you use?

We would like to assemble links to HDF/HDF5 conversion tools,
particularly any that are not already on our software tools pages:

    http://hdfgroup.org/tools5.html
    http://hdfgroup.org/tools.html

If you know of any such tools, please consider contacting the THG
Helpdesk (help@hdfgroup.org) with this information.  It could greatly
benefit other users.
