Release of BioHDF pipeline prototype
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of the BioHDF pipeline prototype,
built and tested using HDF5-1.8.4 Patch 1 (with the HDF5 1.6 compatibility
flag).  This release is intended to demonstrate the capability of HDF5
to store read, alignment, annotation and reference sequence data used in
analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data.  It is implemented
as a set of command-line tools similar to samtools.

This release and some sample data can be obtained from the BioHDF web 
page at:

Platforms Tested
----------------

This release was built and tested on 32- and 64-bit linux systems on
x86/x64 hardware.  It has not been tested on Windows though it is
likely to work with Cygwin.  It is available as source code only
(no binaries).



Major Improvements
------------------

      * NCList-based indexing for alignment hits and annotations, ensuring
        efficient and correct query results.
      * SAM/BAM/samtools integration.
