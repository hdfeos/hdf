    Fortran compiler version 8.1 Beta.

  o This release contains numerous bug fixes, including:

      with the right sequence of deleted objects.

    - Fixed several problems with variable length datatypes.

    - Fixed a couple of problems with hyperslab selections. 

    - Fixed bug where scalar dataspaces for attributes were reporting as
      simple dataspaces.

      change which could corrupt data when converting from double->float.
