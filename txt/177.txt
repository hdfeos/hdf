Changes that affect maintainers of HDF5-dependent applications are listed on the HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release page.
Binary compatibility issue and workaround
HDF5 1.8.22 binaries can replace the previous HDF5 version to run with applications compiled and linked with HDF5 1.8.21 and possibly HDF5 versions as early as 1.8.15.  However, HDF5 checks versions in lib files against versions in header files used to compile the application and will cause the application to abort when they do not match.  An environment variable HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK can be set to 2 to skip the check, to 1 to warn but not abort, or to 0 for the default behavior, aborting when the HDF5 version in the lib files does not match the version in the header files.
Future of HDF5 1.8
Please be aware that the next release (HDF5 1.8.23) is expected to be the last releases for HDF5 1.8. We encourage users to move to HDF5 1.10.7 or to HDF5 1.12.1 which will be released soon.
