New Features and Changes
------------------------

HDF5-1.8.10 is a minor release, but contains several important new
features and bug fixes. Changes in this release include the following:

 o Two new query APIs were added to the Parallel library:

    H5Pget_mpio_no_collective_cause - retrieves reasons why the
         collective I/O was broken during read/write I/O access.

    H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode_f - Fortran counterpart to
         H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode (already in library for retrieving
         the parallel I/O type performed).

 o The h5import utility now allows the use of h5dump output as input
   into h5import.

 o The conversion tests no longer fail in dt_arith.c on Mac OS X 10.7
   or 10.8.

 o The windows pre-built binaries are now provided with debug information.
   This enables users to debug their HDF5 applications using the pre-built
   binaries.

This release contains many other changes and bug fixes not listed here,
including fixes to various tools. Please be sure to read the Release
Notes for a comprehensive list of new features and bug fixes:

release:

 o Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 32-bit

Also, we will no longer provide the VS project files for Windows after
this release, and will be moving to CMake 2.8.10. 



Release of HDF4 File Content Map Writer 1.0.4
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of HDF4 File Content Map Writer
