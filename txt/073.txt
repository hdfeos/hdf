Release of HDF Java Products 1.3
================================

The latest release of the HDF Java Products, version 1.3,
is now available for download from:

    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/

This release was built and tested with HDF5-1.6.0.

For a list of the new features that are available with HDFView
in this release, see the HDFView page at:

  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/hdfview/


Data Corruption Bug in HDF5
===========================

There is a data corruption problem in HDF5-1.6.0 and previous releases 
which affects users who use the H5Pset_istore_k and H5Pget_istore_k 
functions to control B-trees for indexing chunked datasets. This feature 
has been disabled in the HDF5-1.4.5-post8 snapshot, and fixed in the 
HDF5-1.6.0-post* and development (HDF5-1.7*) snapshots. The fix required 
a slight change to the HDF5 format.

The latest HDF5 snapshots can be downloaded from:

    ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/pub/outgoing/hdf5/snapshots/

Detailed Information:

The HDF5 library provides API calls to control B-trees for indexing chunked 
datasets. The non-default 'K' value can be set up during file creation 
time and retrieved from the file creation property list by using the 
H5Pset_istore_k and H5Pget_istore_k functions.  

The HDF5 library (1.6.0 release and any earlier releases) has the 
following problem:

When a non-default indexed storage B-tree internal 'K' value is set, the 
chunked datasets created in the file use the user's 'K' value. The data 
can be accessed correctly until the file is closed. After the file is 
closed, the non-default 'K' value is lost, since it is not stored in the 
file. This may cause data corruption for the chunked datasets with the 
non-default 'K' value.

In HDF5-1.4.5-post8, the H5Pset_istore_k function will not allow the 
default 'K' value to be changed, so no error is generated. In the 
HDF5-1.6.0-post* and HDF5-1.7* snapshots, the library properly stores and 
uses the user-defined 'K' value.

If your application uses non-default 'K' values for chunked datasets, we 
strongly recommend that you move to the next appropriate version of the 
library. 
 

SGI IRIX64 and HP-UX 11.00 Support
==================================

We will be losing access to the SGI IRIX64 and HP-UX 11.00 machines 
that we use.  If you have a machine running one of these platforms, 
and can give us an account on it, please let us know.
