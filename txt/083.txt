New Features and Changes
------------------------

The major new features and changes in HDF5-1.6.4 are:

o  The High-Level (HL) C APIs have been added to HDF5.  The HL
   library, libhdf5_hl.a(so), is built and installed by default.
   Use --disable-hl configure flag to disable the HL library. 

o  This version of HDF5 was built and tested with SZIP 2.0.

o  A new utility, h5jam, is now available.  This utility allows
   the contents of a text file to be added to the "user block" at 
   the beginning of an HDF5 file. 

o  Many changes were made to the library to improve performance,
   especially for variable length datatypes and the metadata cache.

Please refer to the RELEASE.txt file in the source code for a 
comprehensive list of new features and changes.

HDF Java Products Release 2.2
=============================

The latest version of the HDF Java Products, version 2.2, 
is available.  This version was tested with HDF5-1.6.4 and
HDF 4.2r1.  The HDF Java Products can be downloaded from the 
following page:

  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/

Version 2.2 includes bug fixes and a few new features.  
Following is a list of the major changes in HDFView with this
release: 

 o You can now view datasets with:
   - A compound or nested compound variable length datatype
   - An Enum Datatype

 o You can view compound variable-length attributes

 o Added an indicator of attributes (objects with attribute attached)

 o Added a slider bar for modifying image threshold range 
   

Fix for hrepack
===============

There was a problem with the hrepack tool that came with
HDF 4.2r1.  This problem affected datasets for which no data 
had been written.  The hrepack tool was incorrectly exiting in           
this case.  The correct behavior for hrepack is to continue, 
creating the output as an empty dataset.

The changes which enable hrepack to continue for empty datasets 
can be obtained from the directory:
 
  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current/src/patches/

The file containing the changed files is:
    4.2r1-hrepack-patch.tar

Only one file (hrepack_sds.c) is required.  However, tests are also
included with the patch.
  
Download 4.2r1-hrepack-patch.tar, untar it, and replace the files in 
the ./HDF4.2r1/mfhdf/hrepack/ directory of the HDF 4.2r1 source code, 
with these files.


HDF Web-browser Plugin (revisited)
==================================

In case you missed reading about it in a previous newsletter, 
we now have the HDF Web-browser Plugin, which can extend a web 
browser to display HDF4 and HDF5 files. 

This version of the HDF Web-browser Plugin is for Windows 
Only.  It can be downloaded from the following page:

  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/plugins/

The HDF Web-browser Plugin is different from HDFView.  Unlike 
HDFView, it is a 'light browser', with less browsing features 
and no editing features.  It is also not an applet.  It is 
downloaded and installed once, whereas an applet is downloaded 
with each invocation.

Please try it out and let us know what you think about it.
