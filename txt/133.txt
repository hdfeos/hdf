Release of h5edit version 1.1.0
===============================

H5edit version 1.1.0 is now available from the JPSS project Downloads page:
    
   http://www.hdfgroup.org/projects/npoess/jpss_downloads.html

New Features and Changes in this release include:

  o  Support was added for the --atomic option which will maintain a
     backup file that can be used to recover the original data file in the
     event that errors occur. 

  o  The testh5edit.sh script no longer fails with an output mismatch error
     when h5edit is built with HDF5-1.8.9. Please note that with this change
     h5edit 1.1.0 is not backward compatible with HDF5 releases prior to
     HDF5-1.8.9.

   o Support was added for COPY and RENAME commands for attributes.

The h5edit tool is a general command line tool to edit HDF5 files. The
current version is limited to operations on attributes only. For more
information see:

Release of nagg version 1.5.0-beta
==================================

A new release of nagg, version 1.5.0-beta is available from the JPSS
project Downloads page:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/projects/npoess/jpss_downloads.html

This version:

  o Extends the "-l filename" option to process geolocation information
    according to the specified file in addition to number of granules and
    type of products. 
  
  o Extends the notion of compatible geolocation products to allow, for
    example, packaging an SDR product with a terrain-corrected geolocation
    product. 

Nagg is an NPP-specific tool for aggregating JPSS data granules from
existing files into new files. For more information on this tool, see:
