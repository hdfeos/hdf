  - Release of HDF5-1.8.14
  - Book Release:  "High Performance Parallel I/O"
  - HDF Software Highlights


Release of HDF5-1.8.14
======================

The HDF5-1.8.14 release is now available and can be downloaded from The HDF
Group Downloads page:   http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/

It can also be obtained directly from:
   http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

HDF5-1.8.14 is a minor release with a few new features and changes. Important
changes include:

 o The "can't insert duplicate key" issue that occurred in HDF5-1.8.13 has been
   resolved. A new internal structure had been introduced in anticipation for
   handling 64-bit object identifiers in a future release. An unanticipated
   side-effect of this new structure was that when objects were closed, the
   memory was not being properly freed. Applications that open and close many
   objects and which use HDF5-1.8.13 should be moved to HDF5-1.8.14.

 o The shared library version number (soname) changed due to renamed symbols in H5Ppublic.h.

 o CMake 3.* is required in this release.

 o Several issues with string handling were resolved in the HDF5 High-level APIs.

This release contains many other changes that are not listed here. Please be
sure to read the Release Notes for a comprehensive list of new features and
changes:

Changes that affect maintainers of HDF5-dependent applications are listed on
the HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release page. See:

Future Changes to Supported Platforms:

After this release, support will be dropped for CentOS 5 i686 and x86_64, as
well as Mac OS X 10.7. Support will be added for Mac OS X 10.10 and CentOS 7
x86_64.


Book Release: "High Performance Parallel I/O"
============================================

"High Performance Parallel I/O" was released at the end of October.  This
book, edited by Prabhat (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and Quincey
Koziol (The HDF Group), draws on insights from leading practitioners,
researchers, software architects, developers, and scientists who shed light on
the parallel I/O ecosystem. For complete details, see:

HDF Software Highlights
=======================

New HDF tools and applications are continually being developed. Although The
HDF Group does not endorse any particular product, we are pleased that these
products support HDF. For those who might be interested, here are some of the
new (and new versions of) applications that we are aware of:

   h4mapwriter 1.0.7 was released and now supports HDF 4.2.10. This utility creates
   an HDF4 file content map for a given HDF4 file. For details see:
      http://www.hdfgroup.org/projects/h4map/h4map_writer.html

   The HDF4 OPeNDAP Handler 3.11.6 and HDF5 OPeNDAP Handler 2.2.3 were released.
   They include performance enhancements and CF support for more HDF5 Earth
   Science data products. For details, see the home pages for these handlers at:
      http://www.hdfeos.org/software/hdf4_handler.php and
      http://www.hdfeos.org/software/hdf5_handler.php

   H5FD_sec2j is a user implementation of journaling for the default SEC2 file
   driver in HDF5. See:  http://algoholic.eu/sec2j-journalling-for-hdf5/

   LVHDF5 Toolkit v1.0 provides a nearly complete interface between LabVIEW and
   HDF5. See:  http://www.upvi.net/main/index.php/products/lvhdf5

   Ceemple v0.6.9 (C++ technical computing environment) now includes the latest
   version of HDF5.  It is available from the Ceemple web site:
      http://www.ceemple.com/

We would like to continue highlighting applications that use HDF. Please let
us know about your software if you have not already done so. You can do so by
