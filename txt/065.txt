2nd Beta Release of HDF5 High Level API Software
================================================

The second beta release of the HDF5 High Level API software is now available 
from the HDF5 Home Page.  The URL is:

    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/hdf5_hl/doc/

This release includes:

    o   A new "Table API" (H5TB) for manipulating table datasets.
        The Table API defines a standard storage for HDF5 datasets that are
        intended to be interpreted as tables.  A table is defined as a
        collection of records whose values are stored in fixed-length
        fields.  All records have the same structure and all values in each
        field have the same datatype.

    o   Many new functions for HDF5 Lite (H5L).

    o   More examples for the HDF5 Lite (H5L) and HDF5 Image (H5IM) APIs.


The HDF5 High Level APIs consist of higher-level functions which do more 
operations per call than the basic HDF5 interface.  The purpose is to 
simplify and standardize operations within HDF5.

We welcome (and encourage!) you to send us any comments you might have 
regarding this software. You can send them to:

   hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu
   


Release of Java HDF Products Version 2.7
========================================

Version 2.7 of the Java HDF Products, built to work with HDF 4.1r5, is now 
available from:
 
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/

The changes since the 2.6 release are:

  *  All bugs in our database were fixed.

  *  The JHI was upgraded and built on HDF 4.1r5.  It includes bug
     fixes and some new API calls.

  *  Remote file access and the Java HDF Server (JHS) were deleted.
     The code had not been tested for two years, and likely would
     not work.  It was removed in order to avoid possible maintenance 
     problems.

  *  The Java HDF Products no longer include the Java Runtime
     Environment (JRE) due to Sun's license restrictions.


Upcoming HDF-EOS Workshop 
=========================

The HDF-EOS Workshop, originally scheduled for last September, will be 
held in conjunction with the Science Data Processing Workshop on 
February 26th, 27th, and 28th, 2002, in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The HDF
sessions will be a separate "track" of the workshop, but in the same
conference facility.  Information regarding it can be found on the 
HDF-EOS Standards and Tools Information Center web page:

   http://hdfeos.gsfc.nasa.gov/hdfeos/workshop.cfm

Please check this page if you would like to register, participate, or 
just find out about this workshop.
