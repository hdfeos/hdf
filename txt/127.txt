HDF5-1.8.9 is a minor release, but contains several important new
features and bug fixes. Changes in this release include the following:

 - Committed datatypes can now be merged when copying objects, using
   the new flag H5O_COPY_MERGE_COMMITTED_DTYPE_FLAG. Several new
   API routines have been included in support of this feature.

 - A file in memory can now be accessed in the same way as a file on
   disk. New APIs were added to support this feature.

 - Many changes to the tools have been made, including the following:

   o The h5repack performance has been improved dramatically for large
     chunked datasets. 
 
   o The -S (or --summary) option was added to h5stat to display a
     summary of the file space usage for a file.

   o A wildcard can now be used with h5dump to specify multiple files.

 - H5LTpath_valid was added to determine if a path is correct and a
   link resolves to a valid object.

 - The Fortran counterpart to H5Ocopy, h5ocopy_f, was added.

This release contains many other changes and bug fixes not listed
here. Please be sure to read the Release Notes for a comprehensive
