Release of HDF5 1.8.3
=====================

As of May 14th, the HDF5 1.8.3 release has been made available from the
HDF5 home page.

 PLEASE NOTE: If you downloaded the 1.8.3 software prior to May 14, 2009,
 you may encounter some performance issues, as discussed in the following
 document:

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/faq/mcacheconf.html
 
 Please download the software again to ensure that you have the latest
 officially released version.

The HDF5 Home Page is located here:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/index.html

To download HDF5 1.8.3, see this page:

There are several new features and changes in HDF5 1.8.3,
which include:

 o The addition of new C functions (and some Fortran counterparts).

   The following functions have been added to enable raw data chunk
   cache properties to be set on a dataset access property list:

     H5Pset_chunk_cache (h5pset_chunk_cache_f)
     H5Pget_chunk_cache (h5pget_chunk_cache_f)
     H5Dget_access_plist (h5dget_access_plist_f)
 
     For further details, see the RFC:
        http://www.hdfgroup.org/pubs/rfcs/RFC_chunk_cache_functions.pdf
     
   The following functions have been added to allow greater flexibility
   when traversing external links:

     H5Pset_elink_cb
     H5Pget_elink_cb
     H5Pset_elink_acc_flags
     H5Pget_elink_acc_flags
   
     For further details, see the RFC, at:
        http://www.hdfgroup.org/pubs/rfcs/RFC_elink_callback.pdf

   Other new functions are:

     H5Iis_valid (h5iis_valid_f)
     H5set_free_list_limits

 o API versioning was added to the H5Z_class_t structure. H5Z_class_t is
   the structure used to define a user-defined filter.  With this change,
   it will be easier to migrate applications that use user-defined filters
   to 1.8, and no changes to the code for registering the filter should be
   necessary.  HOWEVER, this can cause problems for existing applications
   that link with the HDF5 1.8 library and use the 1.6 API, as H5Z_class_t
   will now map to the old structure definition.  This can be fixed by
   modifying the code to take this into account, so the old version of the
   structure is used whenever compiling against 1.8.3.  It can also be fixed
   by defining the macro H5Z_class_t_vers to 2 before including hdf5.h, to
   force the library to use the newer H5Z_class_t regardless of the API
   setting.

 o The contents of the libhdf5.settings file has been embedded
   into the hdf5 executables so that "orphaned" executables can
   display (via the Unix strings command, for example) the library
   settings used to build the executables.

 o Many bug fixes

Status of HDF5 1.6
==================

Please note that there will only be one more release of HDF5 1.6
(version HDF5 1.6.10), due out in November 2009. Although it is
not yet urgent to move to the HDF5 1.8 release, users are encouraged to
do so when possible.


Support Status of .NET 2003
===========================

HDF5 1.6.9 and HDF5 1.8.3 are the last HDF5 releases to
support .NET 2003.
