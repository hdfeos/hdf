Release of H4 to H5 Version 2.1
===============================

A new version of the H4 to H5 software, version 2.1,
is now available.  This version was built with HDF5 1.8.2
and HDF 4.2r4.

Numerous enhancements and bug fixes have been added to this
release, most of which are related to converting HDF-EOS2 files to
HDF5 files that can be read by the netCDF-4 APIs. More information can
be found in the RELEASE.txt file in the release_docs/ directory of the
h4h5tools source code distribution.

An optional "verify" tool has also been provided to enable applications
that convert HDF-EOS2 files to netCDF-4 files to verify the correctness
of the converted results.

The H4 to H5 software can be downloaded from:

 http://www.hdfgroup.org/h4toh5/


Dropping VS 6.0
===============

We will be dropping Visual Studio 6.0 for both HDF4 and HDF5 1.6
products, after the HDF 4.2r4 release.
