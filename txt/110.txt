Release of HDF 4.2.5
====================

We are pleased to announce the release of HDF 4.2.5. It can be obtained
from the HDF Downloads page:

  http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html#hdf4

New features and changes in HDF 4.2.5 include:

- SDgetchunkinfo now contains compression type and compression
  information.  If a failure occurs while getting compression information,
  the associated compression parameters will be set to -1 to indicate
  that no compression information was retrieved (rather than simply failing).

- A vgroup name and class name can now be more than the previous limit
  of 64 characters.  Two public functions (Vgetnamelen, Vgetclassnamelen) have
  been provided for applications to allocate sufficient space for these items.

- SDreset_maxopenfiles was added to allow users to reset the number of files
  that can be open at the same time to the system limit minus 3. 

- "make installcheck" was added to build and test examples using h4cc and
  h4fc.

- The -k flag was added to "hdp dumpsds" to display SDSs in the order they are
  specified on the command line.

- The -V option to print the library version string was added to many tools.

- Support was added for 64-bit Mac Intel.

- Many bugs were fixed.

Please see the HDF 4.2.5 release notes for complete details on what has changed
