JAVA-based HDF browser available
--------------------------------

A prototype JAVA-based HDF browser is currently available on the HDF 
information server.  Please check http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf/java/docs
for more information.  The browser provides the following features: 

. Displays the structure of an HDF file using different icons for
  the object types 
. Allows a user to ``descend'' levels of vgroups by clicking on
  vgroups (represented as folders) 
. Displays information about objects, such as the dimensions of
  an SDS and the names and values of its attributes. 
. For 2-D arrays (SDS and raster images), displays a subsampled
  image, and also allows a user to look at the image in its full
  resolution if desired in the separate window. 
. For 3-D arrays (SDS) supports animation through the first
  dimension, including simple animation controls such as
  animation speed, single stepping, and backward and forward
  animation. 
. Displays a spreadsheet for SDS and GR objects. Allows the user
  to outline a rectangular section of an image and creates the
  corresponding spreadsheet. Also allows one to highlight a
  region in a spreadsheet then draws the corresponding rectangle
  on the image. 
. Makes a basic scaled or interpolated image for the highlighted
  datasets with a user-provided expansion factor.
. Displays a spreadsheet for a vdata object.  
  
The current version of the browser has been tested on the following 
Java enabled platforms: 

  Solaris 2.5 
  IRIX 5.3 
  Linux-elf 
  DEC/Alpha 

Support for IRIX 6.2
--------------------

Though HDF 4.0r2 is not officially supported on IRIX 6.2, it
has been tested on a Power Challenge running IRIX 6.2 and appears
to run properly.  Currently, this is the only IRIX 6.2 machine on 
which 4.0r2 has been tested.  

The HDF 4.0r2  binaries for IRIX 6.1 provided on our ftp server 
will run properly on the Power Challenge running IRIX 6.2.

Creating MIPS4 code for IRIX 6.2 on the Power Challenge
-------------------------------------------------------

When running HDF4.0r2 under IRIX 6.2, users need to specify the compile
option -mips4 as well as -n32 to create MIPS4 code.  

For Irix 6.1, the OS with which HDF 4.0r2 is compiled, the -n32
option implies MIPS4 code.  For Irix 6.2, -n32 alone implies MIPS3 code.  
We plan to include the -mips4 option as well as the -n32 option in our
next release.  In the meantime, users are advised to use "-n32 -mips4" 
together, even if they are working on an IRIX 6.1 system.  Rest assured 
that the binary release of HDF 4.0r2 for Irix6.1_n32 is MIPS4 code.

Win_NT release of HDF4.0r2
--------------------------

An HDF 4.0 release 2 distribution for Windows NT/95 is available on
the ftp server in HDF/HDF_Current/zip/.

FTP server changes
------------------

/HDF/HDF_Current/tar/ contains the packed source code for the latest
release of HDF.  We have added a gzip-compressed tar file, which is 
considerably smaller than the standard unix "compress"ed (.Z) version, 
as well as a directory of source code which has been tar'ed, gzip'ed, 
and chopped into 100Kb pieces.
                
/HDF/HDF_Current/bin/ contains pre-compiled code for the latest release
of HDF.  It contains a directory for each platform, under which we have 
replaced the "compress"ed (.Z) tar file of the entire HDF distribution 
with a smaller gzip-compressed tar file.  We did this in the interest of 
space and ftp transfer time, however if this poses a problem for anyone, 
please let us know at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

We also created a "utilities" subdirectory under each
/HDF/HDF_Current/bin/<platform> directory which contains binaries of the
individual HDF utilities for the corresponding platform. 

New contributions
-----------------

Thank you to Ralph Schleicher, Robert Pincus, Russ Rew, and Yotam Medini
for their contributions to the HDF community.  They are available on the
HDF ftp server in HDF/contrib/.

Ralph Schleicher has contributed his shared HDF4.0r1p1 libdf.a and libmfhdf.a 
libraries compiled with Linux 1.2.3 (ELF).  A pointer to these libraries is 
located in the subdirectory LINUX/4.0r1p1_shared/README.
 
Robert Pincus (Robert.Pincus@gsfc.nasa.gov) and Russ Rew (russ@unidata.ucar.edu)
have contributed a Fortran-90 module for netcdf.  If you use the netCDF API to
access the HDF library, you can use this module instead of including netcdf.inc 
in your F90 program.  The contributed software is in subdirectory F90_netCDF/.

Yotam Medini (yotam@sj-coop.net) has contributed hdfv 1.3.  The hdfv 1.3 tool
is an HDF read-only interface via TCL.  It contains "tclhdf" and "hdfv".
"tclhdf" is a simple extension of tclsh, with HDF's Vgroup/Vdata queries.
"hdfv" is an HDF-Viewer with a GUI based on Tk.  Currently, it only supports 
the Vgroup/Vdata model.  The contribution is in subdirectory hdfv/.

If you have a question about HDF, sending it to HDF technical support
at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu is often a good first step.  

If you want to broadcast HDF technical questions to other HDF users in 
order to solicit their assistance,  the sci.data.formats newsgroup is 
currently the most widely used avenue for this.  sci.data.formats is an 
appropriate forum for questions regarding file formats including, but
not limited to, HDF.
