This newsletter marks the release of three new versions of the HDF software:

    HDF5 1.8.0, HDF5 1.6.7, and HDF 4.2r3

HDF5 1.8.0 is a major release with file format changes, as well as many new
features. The file format changes will affect backward/forward compatibility
with previous releases.  For detailed information on how this may affect
your existing HDF5 applications and files, please read the document on
"New Features in Release 1.8.0 and Format Compatibility Considerations":

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/CompatFormat180.html

Not all users with existing applications will be willing or able to move to
the HDF5 1.8.0 release because of these major changes.  We are therefore
continuing to support the HDF5 1.6 branch of HDF5.  HDF5 1.6.7 is a point
release with a few important changes, described below.

The HDF 4.2r3 release is also a point release with a few changes.


Release of HDF5 1.8.0

All new and modified APIs are listed in detail in the "HDF5 Software Changes

  http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html

For detailed information on platforms supported, supported configuration
features and known problems, please refer to the release notes:

Release of HDF5 1.6.7
=====================

The latest release of HDF5 1.6, version 1.6.7, is now available from the
HDF5 web page at:

  http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/

The HDF5 1.6.7 release can be obtained from:

  http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain516.html

Documentation for HDF5 1.6.7 can be found at:

  http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/

Changes in 1.6.7 include:

  - The library's behavior has been changed when reading files that may have
    had corrupted object header information.  By default, the library now
    rebuilds the correct object header information instead of issuing an
    error. The previous 'strict' file format interpretation can be
    enabled with the "--enable-strict-format-checks" configure option.

  - The stream I/O driver has been removed from the distribution.

The "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release" document lists API-level
changes between HDF5 1.6.7 and earlier releases:

The HDF 4.2r3 documentation will soon be available from:
   
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc.html

Changes in HDF 4.2r3 include:
   
  - Support for Windows 64-bit.

  - Improvements to the configuration when building without NetCDF-3:
    The presence of the NetCDF-3 header files is no longer required to
    build the HDF4 library with the --without-netcdf configuration flag.

  - A fix for the problem where more than one variable has the same name.
    New APIs were added to handle non-uniquely named variables.
    (SDgetnumvars_byname, SDnametoindices)
