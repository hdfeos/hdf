What's new in HDF 3.3 Beta 2
        
        o netCDF 2.3.2 support
        o added routine SDfindattr() to find an attribute given its
                name
        o sometimes SDreaddata() would return incorrect fill values
                when no data had been written
        o programs using Vset routines should no longer need to
                explicitly include vg.h
        o fixed problem in multi-file interface when sharing
                dimensions between datasets
        o the base library now works on the Mac with MPW3.2 C and 
                Language System Fortran
        o a number of memory leaks (including two huge ones) were fixed
        o added routine SDsetexternalfile() (documented below) to
                store a dataset's data in a separate file
        o a number of bugs in the handling of old SDS files by the new
                interface were fixed
        o the base library works on PC except the slab routines 
        o the base library passed test on VMS except little endian 
                float64

HDF FAQ

    We have put together 27 frequently asked questions about HDF and
    its applications. It is in the directory HDF/ on the NCSA ftp server.
    It is a living file and will be changed along with the development 
    of HDF. A suggested bug report form is included in the FAQ. Hope users
    use the form to report to us the bugs. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

New contributions from HDF users

    Several users donated their software to our HDF user community. These
    contributions are kept in the subdirectory HDF/contrib/ on the NCSA ftp
    server. See the README file in the same directory for more detail about
    the software and the contributor. A brief list of the contributions 
    follows.

    o Peter Schweitzer contributed his port of HDF3.2r4 to Watcom C/386. 
      The contribution includes a README, a Makefile, a compiled optimized 
      HDF library (C only), and the UNIX diff files of the source code. 

    o NCSA fix32atr 
      A C program fix32luf.c is written to fix the label/unit/format problem
      in hdf files written by releases 1 -- 3 of HDF3.2. See 
      HDF/newsletter/Newsletter8 for more detail. 

    o Andrea Leone of Scientific Visualization Group Centre for Advanced 
      Studies, R&D in Sardinia, Italy made some modification of HDF3.2r4 
      library to avoid the limitation on the number of Velements in a single 
      Vgroup.

    o Nathan contributed his modifications to hfile.h and hfile.c in order to
      get HDF 3.2r4 to compile with Think C++ 6.0.  Hdf.note lists the changes
      in those files.

    o Michael E. Mauel, Department of Applied Physics, Columbia 
      University contributed his changes to HDF3.2r3 to compile
      it with THINK C v6.0. An HDF3.2r3.THINK_C.README and some
      examples are also included in the subdirectory HDF3.2r3.THINK_C/.

    o Neil Buesing of EROS Data Center at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, contributed
      InspectHDF.c. InspectHDF.c is developed to display information on HDF files.

    o Utility sds2ris.c is also contributed by Neil Buesing. It reads SDS's from 
      input file and writes the data out as RIS's in the output file.
 
    o Joshua Goldstein from Research Systems contributed his port of HDF3.2r1 to 
      the Alpha running VMS.


Update on NCSA tools: Mosaic and Collage

    o Collage 1.2 Beta is released on the ftp. In addition to the bug fixes,

      For more details please wait for a formal announcement from the Collage 
      developers!

    o NCSA Mosaic 1.2 

      NCSA Mosaic is an Internet-based global hypermedia browser, available
      on the NCSA anonymous ftp server. It contains an HDF browser.
