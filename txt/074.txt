New Features and Changes
------------------------

The major new features and changes in HDF5-1.6.1 are:

  o Added new H5Fget_freespace() routine to query the free space in a file.

  o Added a few new C++ functions.
 
  o Added support for gcc 3.3.1.

  o Fortran90 APIs are being integrated into the main body of the HDF5 
    Reference Manual (RM).  This process is complete in all RM sections
    except H5P.

  o Many bugs were fixed in this release, including the following: 

     - Fixed potential file corruption bug when too many object header
       messages (probably attributes, from a user perspective) were
       inserted into an object header and certain other conditions were
       met.  

     - Corrected some problems with variable-length datatypes.

     - Corrected some problems with the H5Tget_native_type function.
 
     - Corrected bug where H5Gunlink caused file corruption.

     - Corrected errors with using point selections to access data in
       chunked datasets.  

     - Modified library and file format to support storing indexed storage
       (chunked dataset) B-tree's with non-default internal 'K' values.

     - Fixed the error that caused "make install" to fail because of the
       macro definition syntax of "prefix?=..."
