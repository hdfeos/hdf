This release contains many important new features and changes, including:
HDF5 now supports building with the AEC library as a replacement library for SZip.
CVE-2018-13870, CVE-2018-13869 and CVE-2018-17435 were fixed in this release.
Metadata cache optimization was added to improve performance.
A CMake option was added to link generated Fortran MOD files into the include directory.
Autotools and CMake options were added to enable or disable file locking. C functions and C++, Fortran and Java wrappers were also added for setting and getting the file locking parameters.
The Splitter VFD was added. It maintains separate R/W and W/O channels for ”concurrent” file writes to two files using a single HDF5 file handle.
The Mirror VFD was added. It uses TCP/IP sockets to perform write-only (W/O) file I/O on a remote machine.
Several hyperslab selection functions were added in this release.
Internal memory sanity checking was disabled in Autotools debug builds by default. The sanity checking replaced C API malloc(3) and free(3) calls with HDF5 internal calls, which caused problems with the external filter plugins.
Several tools issues were fixed (h5diff, h5repack).
The High Level H5DSis_scale function was fixed to correctly handle CLASS and DIMENSION_SCALE attributes that were not written according to the Dimension Scales Specification.
For details regarding these and other changes please be sure to see the release notes.
