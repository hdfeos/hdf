Minor Change to SZIP Configuration
==================================

A minor configuration change was made to the SZIP source code.  It fixed
the problem where the math library was not getting included when building
SZIP.

The change did not affect the pre-built binaries. 

You can obtain the updated SZIP source code from the following location:

  ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.1/src/

Please note that the SZIP version was not updated for this change.



FTP Provider Changes
====================

Due to problems in the past, we have instituted changes to our FTP provider,
and have hopefully resolved all of the issues. Also note that the FTP server
can now be accessed from the HDF web pages, for those who are interested:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/

If you encounter any problems with the HDF Group web or FTP site, please
send the HDF Helpdesk the error message you are getting, along with the time
and timezone, and your IP Address.


Matlab Examples
===============

The Mathworks graciously provided us with example programs for using HDF5 with
MATLAB.  These can be found on the HDF5 home page, and the link to them is:

  http://www.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/UserSupport/matlab-examples/api16-m.html

If you have any questions regarding them, please let us know.
