High Level API Changes
======================

A proposal has been made to change the names of the attributes used in
the Image and Table APIs to names that are unique to HDF5.  Some users
already have attributes defined with the names that are currently used, 
which has caused problems.  However, changing the names of the attributes 
will affect all users of the High Level APIs and will require changes 
to their software.  To ease this inconvenience we would plan on 
keeping the old attribute names for a number of releases.

We would like to know how many users are currently using the High Level 
APIs and the impact that this change will make on them.  Please send
this information to:  help@hdfgroup.org



File Format Changes in HDF5-1.7 
===============================

Users of the development software that we provide, need to be aware of 
the changes that we will be adding from now until the release of HDF5-1.8.  
The development code is provided as odd-numbered releases or 'snapshots'.  
The current development software is 5-1.7, which, when completed, will 
become the 5-1.8 release.

Please note that the developers are making changes to 5-1.7 that will 
modify the file format.  These format changes are likely to be modified 
further in later snapshots before the 5-1.8 release.  Some of these 
changes may not be carried over into the final 1.8 release, so that 
your files created with a 1.7 snapshot may not be readable by HDF5-1.8 or 
any future release. 

We will thoroughly document these changes in the release notes of the 
snapshots.


Windows MPICH Support
=====================

We have investigated what is needed to support MPICH on Windows.
We would like to get a feel for how many users are interested in
this, so that we can determine what level of support to offer.
At minimum, we will provide detailed instructions on how to use it. 

If you are interested in Windows MPICH support, please send us
a message at:  help@hdfgroup.org


Web Site to Obtain HDF-EOS Software 
===================================

The HDF-EOS project's Tools and Information web page is not 
active.  If you need to obtain the HDF-EOS, EOSView or SDP Toolkit 
software, it is available from the following page:
