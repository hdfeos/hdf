Release of HDF5-1.8.15
======================

The HDF5-1.8.15 release is now available and can be downloaded from The HDF
Group Downloads page:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/

It can also be obtained from:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

HDF5-1.8.15 is a minor release with a few new features and changes. Important
changes include:

 o Support was added for the following platforms:

   - Linux 3.10
   - Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10
   - AIX 6.1

 o Several new C functions were added to HDF5:

   - H5allocate_memory() and H5resize_memory() were added to resolve
     heap corruption issues and crashes (especially on Windows). They
     allow filter authors to allocate or resize memory using the same
     memory allocation library that HDF5 uses.  
   
   - H5PLset_loading_state() and H5PLget_loading_state() were added
     for improving control of dynamically loaded plugin libraries.

 o Numerous changes and improvements were made to the C++, Fortran, and
   High Level APIs.  

 o Many configuration changes were made in this release. They include the
   following:

   - Old (or unused) options and platform files were removed, including those
     for VMS.
   - The minimum CMake version was moved to 3.1. 
   - WiX packaging was added for CMake on Windows.
