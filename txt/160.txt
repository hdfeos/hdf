This release contains several major new features and changes, including the following:

 o Parallel HDF5 includes several improvements:

   . Compressed datasets can now be written using the MPI I/O driver.
   . Optimizations were added to improve performance of the HDF5 parallel open/close/flush operations.
   . MPI I/O transfers now allow reading or writing of more than 2GB of data in a single I/O operation.

  o The following vulnerabilities were addressed:

   . CVE-2017-17505: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17505
   . CVE-2017-17506: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17506
   . CVE-2017-17508: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17508
   . CVE-2017-17509: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17509

  o The following changes were added to the HDF5 library:
 
   . The H5F_LIBVER_V18 parameter can now be specified in the H5Pset_libver_bounds() function to
     provide control over object creation and ensure that files are fully compatible with HDF5-1.8.

     In addition, H5_LIBVER_LATEST is now set to H5F_LIBVER_V110. Please note that any applications
     that call H5Pset_libver_bounds to specify the latest file format will use HDF5-1.10 as the
     latest file format as of this release. (However, the h5format_convert utility can be used to
     change the file format version, if need be.)

   . The issue has been addressed where the path to VDS source files was interpreted (incorrectly)
     as relative to the directory where the executable ran (HDFFV-9724). The location of the
     source files can now be set with a function call or with an environment variable. For details,
     see H5Pset_virtual, and the new APIs H5Pset_virtual_prefix and H5Pget_virtual_prefix.

   . The H5DOread_chunk and H5Dget_chunk_storage_size functions were added to enable and support
     reading a raw data chunk directly from a dataset in a file into a buffer.

   . The H5Fget_eoa and H5Fincrement_filesize functions were added for retrieving and setting
     a file's EOA/EOF. New options were also added to h5clear to do the same:

      --filesize     Print the file’s EOA and EOF
      --increment=C  Set the file’s EOA to the maximum of (EOA, EOF) + C for the file
    
   . The H5FDdriver_query function was added to query a VFL driver for its feature flags when a file is not 
     available.

  o Several changes to CMake were added:
 
   . The minimum CMake version required was changed to 3.10.
   . pkg-config file generation was added.
   . The creation of h5cc and similar compile scripts in builds was added for Linux.

  o C++ API wrappers and classes were added for link operations.

  o Several Java wrappers were added.

There are many other changes not listed here. Please see the release notes for details:
