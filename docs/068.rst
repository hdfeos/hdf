Release of HDF5-1.4.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HDF5-1.4.4 is now available for download. You can obtain the
HDF5-1.4.4 software from the HDF5 home page at:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/

The HDF5 documentation is included in the source code and can also
be downloaded from:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/

This is a fully tested release. The configuration features supported
in this release can be viewed at:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/release/SuppConfigFeats.html

New Features and Changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Important changes in HDF5 include:

o Numerous performance changes were made to the HDF5 sequential and
 parallel libraries.

 In general, the library should make fewer and larger I/O requests when
 accessing a file. Additionally, improvements to the parallel I/O portions
 of the library should reduce the communications and barriers used in
 various internal algorithms, improving the performance of the library.

 However, with the extensive changes to some portions of the library that
 were required for these improvements, some errors or unanticipated results
 may have been introduced. Please report any problems encountered to
 hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

 Hopefully these improvements will benefit all HDF5 applications, but if
 there are particular I/O patterns that appear to be slower than necessary,

.. code-block:: fortran

    please let us know and include a sample program showing the problem
    behavior.


o The H4 to H5 tools have been removed from the main source and are
 now included in the H4toH5 conversion library. The "--with-hdf4"
 command-line option during configure is no longer valid.

o Support for the Intel compilers has been added to HDF5. Intel C++ and
 Intel F90 version 6.0 are both supported on Linux 2.4, and Intel C++
 version 6.0 is supported on Windows 2000.

o Support for zlib 1.1.4 has been added.

o zlib has been removed from the Windows source release. Users can
 download the zlib library for windows from the NCSA ftp server at:
 ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/gzip/windows/

 The Windows binary release was built with zlib 1.1.3.

o Several corruption problems were fixed.

Please refer to the RELEASE.txt file that comes with the source code
for detailed information:

Release of H4toH5 version 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0 of the H4 to H5 conversion library is now available,
and can be downloaded from:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/h4toh5/libh4toh5.html

It includes the h4toh5 and h5toh4 utilities, as well as a library of
functions for converting HDF4 objects into HDF5 objects.

We encourage users to try this software and we welcome feedback
regarding it.


Support for BZIP2 Compression

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We have done a performance study of using bzip2 with an HDF5 file. The
study focused on the performance comparison between bzip2 and gzip.
One important goal of this study was to help the HDF5 group decide whether
or not HDF5 should support bzip2 compression.

Based on the report, the following was observed:

Although bzip2 is always better than gzip in compression ratio within a few
percentage points, bzip2 always takes more processing time than gzip,
especially for decoding time.

Therefore, the HDF group has decided not to officially support the bzip2
library at this time. However, we have provided an example to show
how to use the bzip2 filter in a user application.

Details regarding this can be found at:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/papers/bzip2/


Cray Support to Continue

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In our last newsletter we had mentioned that we were considering dropping
support for the Cray computers. We received several responses regarding
this, as well as help procuring new Cray accounts, and will be able to
continue supporting the Crays.
