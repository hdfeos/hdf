HDF Newsletter #169
===================

HDFView 3.1 is now available from the HDFView home page:
https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/
This release was built and tested with HDF5-1.10.5, HDF 4.2.14, and Open JDK 11. It includes several important new features and changes:
The HDFView software was reworked to reduce code duplication and to improve the display of objects. This will help significantly in maintaining the software.
HDFView can now be built without the HDF4 library.
Support was added for PPC64LE with GTK+-3.0.
Many bugs have also been fixed in this release. For a complete list of the new features and changes, please see the Release Notes.
Please be aware that we currently are not able to provide HDFView packaged on Mac OS X because of changes in Oracle’s licensing of Java. We have moved to the latest version of OpenJDK. However, OpenJDK does not supply a JRE, which is required by the Java Mac packager used by HDFView. We are currently investigating other packaging alternatives. Please contact help@hdfgroup.org for more information regarding this issue.
