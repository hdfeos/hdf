This is the LAST beta version before the actual release of HDF5

software is stable and no new features will be added from now
until 1.8.0 is released.

Following are the major changes in this release from the last beta:

 - Four new functions were added for recursively iterating over Links
 and Objects:

 H5Lvisit, H5Lvisit_by_name
 H5Ovisit, H5Ovisit_by_name

 - The Stream VFD was removed, due to licensing issues. We are
 investigating how we can make it available to the public as
 separate software.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding these
or other THG issues!
