Release of HDF5 High Level APIs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The latest release of the HDF5 High Level APIs, which was tested
using HDF5-1.4.5, is now available from:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf5_hl/

This is the first release of the HDF5 High Level APIs for which
pre-compiled binaries are provided.

The HDF5 High Level APIs are a set of functions built on top of the
basic HDF5 library which define simple interfaces for some common
operations and uses.

The HDF5 HL library includes:

 H5LT API: "higher-level" functions which create and read simple
 datasets and attributes in a few calls.

 H5IM API: Create and read HDF5 Images and Palettes

 H5TB API: Create and read HDF5 Tables

The HDF5 HL library requires the HDF5 library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The latest official release of the HDF Java Products built
with HDF5-1.4.5 is now available. It can be downloaded from:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/

Several new features have been added to HDFView with this release,
including the ability to configure it with HDF4, HDF5, or both.
It can also convert HDF4/HDF5 images to and from JPEG now. For a
list of the new features in HDFView see the HDFView page at:
