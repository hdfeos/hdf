HDFNOW Release 0.3
==================

HDFNOW Release 0.3 is now available on the HDF ftp server (hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu)
in the directory pub/HDFNOW. Please refer to the release_notes file
for information on installing HDFNOW. If you have any questions or
concerns, please email hdfparallel@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

HDFNOW is a library that supports HDF for a Network of Workstations. The
initial design supports the distributed Scientific Datasets for HDF files.

The Distributed SD (DSD) interface is designed for those who are familiar
with the SD interface and experienced with message-passing programs. The
DSD interface is a layer on top of the SD interface, which uses MPI for
interprocess communications.

A. New Features and Changes

 o Linux is now supported.

 o Changes in HDF NOW file structure

 - A library generated string, DHDF_SetId, is stored in each of the
 distributed HDF files (DHDF).

 - A library assigned integer, DHDF_FileId, is stored in each DHDF.

 - The file information of all the files in the same DHDF represented by
 a vdata is stored in the main HDF file (MHF). The file information in
 an associated HDF file contains the information of the MHF and itself.

 Please refer to man/HDFNOW.5 for more information.

 o HDF distribution release 4.1r1

 o MPICH 1.1.0 distribution
