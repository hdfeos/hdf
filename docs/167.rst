HDF Newsletter #167
===================

As part of our commitment to providing the open source community with the latest core library, the HDF5 1.10.4 release is now available for download from:
https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/
The user documentation and source code (only) can be obtained from the Support Portal:
https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support
This release has just a few new features and changes. Important changes include:
A bug was fixed in the parallel library that caused an application to hang if a collective read/write of a chunked dataset occurred when collective metadata reads were enabled and some of the ranks had no selection in the dataset’s dataspace.
Enhanced support was added for using the cross compiling variables in CMake. However, only limited testing was done in this release, and it is not currently well documented.
Default rpaths can now be added for loading dependent libraries without requiring LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set.
For detailed information on the new features and changes in this release, please see the release notes.
