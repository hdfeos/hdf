Patch Release of Java HDF5 Products

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A new version of the Java HDF5 Products is now available from
the Java HDF5 Home page:

 http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf5-html/

This is a patched release of the HDF5 Java Products, H5View Version 2.2
Patch 1.

This updates the release of August 2001. This release fixes several
configuration and packaging bugs.

The changes since the 2.2 release are:

 * The C code in the JHI5 was modified so it can be compiled with
 either a C or a C++ compiler. The logic of the code was not
 changed, only the ifdefs and other changes needed to please the
 C++ compiler and JNI include files for C++.

 * All pre-built binaries including Windows are linked with
 the released version of HDF5-1.4.2. In the first 2.2 release,
 the Windows binaries were linked with a pre-release version
 of HDF5-1.4.2.

 * This version now uses JDK 1.3. The Unix makefiles, configure,
 and run scripts were updated. The pre-built binaries with JRE now
 include the JRE for 1.3.

 * One class file (H5Chart$1.class) was omitted from the Unix jars,
 and the Makefile.in in the 2.2 release. (The file was in the
 source, just missing from the jar file.) This is fixed.
